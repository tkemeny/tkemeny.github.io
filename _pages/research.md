Measuring Creative Economy Employment in the US and UK Using Microdata.</a></h3> 2018. IZA Discussion Paper No. 11740. With Max Nathan and Dave O'Brien.

<p>Using high-quality administrative microdata spanning 2011-2013, this paper develops new routines to compare creative economies using the creative trident framework, and applies them to the UK and US national and regional contexts. We find the UK creative economy is larger in workforce shares, and grows faster over the study period; the US' is absolutely larger, and is distributed more evenly across industries. Regional results are shaped by deeper differences in national urban systems. The paper highlights possibilities for widely varying national configurations of creative economies, considers potential mechanisms driving differentiation, and reflects on the usefulness of the creative trident approach.</p>

<p>Innovative, high-technology activities are seen as motors of development,with knock-on effects  throughout  their  local  economies.Such  activities  tend  to  organisenetworks  that span  beyond atomized firms, creating ‘ecosystems’of  mutual  dependence  as  well  as competition.   However,   such   ecosystems   remain   poorly   understood,   which in   turn constrains the effectiveness of any policy response. This first-steps paper uses the unique, user-generatedCrunchbase  dataset to  fill  some  of  these  gaps. With  rich  information  on founders,  workers,  products  and  early  stage  investment  activity,  Crunchbase  has  great potential  for  ecosystem  understanding.   Like  many  ‘big  data’  resources, however, Crunchbase  requires  cleaning  and  validation  to  make  it  suitable  for  robust  analysis.  We develop  a  novel  approach  to  gapfill  location  data  in  Crunchbase,  exploiting  DNS/IP address information, and run a series of tests on a raw sample of 225,000 company-level observations covering the US, UK and Canada. We provide initial descriptive results, and set out steps for further research</p>
