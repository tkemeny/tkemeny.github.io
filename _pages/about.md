I'm an Associate Professor in the  <a href="https://munkschool.utoronto.ca" target="_blank">Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy</a> at the <a href="https://utoronto.ca" target="_blank"> University of Toronto</a>, and a member of the <a href="https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/ipl" target="_blank">Innovation Policy Lab</a>. I’m also a Visiting Senior Fellow in the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Inequalities" target="_blank"> International Inequalities Institute</a> at the London School of Economics.

I study the spatial structure of work and prosperity. Much of my current research investigates how and why economic opportunity in the United States has become so deeply geographically polarized and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00130095.2023.2244111" target="_blank">income unequal</a>. Some of this work focuses on the role of technology, particularly innovations that are highly <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00343404.2022.2076824" target="_blank">disruptive </a> and rich in  <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/120154/1/III_working_paper_103.pdf" target="_blank">tacit knowledge</a>. I'm also interested in how these technologies enter the world of work, both  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jeg/lbad018" target="_blank">directly</a> and through their wider impacts on workers <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2018.06.005" target="_blank">outside of tech </a>  and in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cjres/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cjres/rsad031/7286403" target="_blank">left behind places</a>. At the same time, my team and I have built the first geographically-granular measures of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03059-9" target="_blank">wealth</a>  in the US, which demonstrate that inequality in communities' wealth levels has grown much larger in recent decades than corresponding spatial income differences.


Another area I focus on is the economics of diversity. In particular, I am investigating the productivity impacts of ethnic- and gender-diverse teams, workplaces, and cities. My work in this area has quantified
 economic benefits of immigrant diversity in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jeg/lbx012" target="_blank">US</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00130095.2021.1897462" target="_blank">Norway</a>. An ongoing project examines these themes in the context of the United Kingdom (details <a href="https://maxnathan.medium.com/a-big-new-esrc-grant-534a0a0cda19" target="_blank">here</a>).


For my study on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cjres/rsx027" target="_blank"> Brexit and immobility</a>, my co-authors and I won the <a href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/2019/07/11/prizes-for-researchers-and-papers-at-understanding-society-conference" target="_blank">Understanding Society Paper Prize</a>. In 2016, my work on the economic value of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jeg/lbv043" target="_blank">local social networks <a/> won the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joeg/pages/urban_land_institute_prize" target="_blank">Urban Land Institute Prize</a> for the best paper published in the <i>Journal of Economic Geography</i>. Back in 2013, I also won an Early Career Award from the Regional Studies Association. 

I serve on the Editorial Board of the <i>Journal of Economic Geography</i>, as well as at <i> Progress in Economic Geography</i>. Between 2017 and 2021, I was an Editor at <i>Regional Studies</i>.

Cutting across my research interests, I’m interested in policy efforts to stimulate prosperity. I have advised governments and NGOs on issues of regional and international development, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.S. Economic Development Administration, and the World Bank. 

Before joining U of T, I held academic appointments at Queen Mary, University of London; the University of Southampton; the London School of Economics; and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I received my PhD from UCLA.
