I am a Professor in the  <a href="https://munkschool.utoronto.ca" target="_blank">Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy</a> at the University of Toronto, as well as a member of its <a href="https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/ipl" target="_blank">Innovation Policy Lab</a>. I’m also a Visiting Senior Fellow in the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Inequalities" target="_blank"> International Inequalities Institute</a> at the London School of Economics.

My award-winning research focuses on cities, in particular the spatial polarization of prosperity and economic opportunity in high-income countries like the United States and Canada.  Under that theme, I have documented the growing 'winner-take-all' nature of today's urbanism. I have explored how growing up in a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cjres/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cjres/rsad031/7286403" target="_blank">left-behind place</a>  shapes the likleihood that a poor child will climb out of poverty in their adulthood. I am also investigating what it means that our most  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00343404.2022.2076824" target="_blank"> important innovations</a> today emerge from only a few locations. Right now, I am leading an international team examining the spatial distribution of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03059-9" target="_blank">wealth</a> in the United States and Canada.  In ongoing work I am linking such forms of inequality to the pervasive housing affordability crisis in America.

My second broad area of focus is the economic implications of immigration. In particular, I am investigating the productivity impacts of birthplace-diverse teams, workplaces, and cities. My work in this area has quantified
 economic benefits of immigrant diversity in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jeg/lbx012" target="_blank">US</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00130095.2021.1897462" target="_blank">Norway</a>. An ongoing project examines these themes in the context of the United Kingdom (details <a href="https://maxnathan.medium.com/a-big-new-esrc-grant-534a0a0cda19" target="_blank">here</a>).

<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cjres/rsad031" target="_blank">"Who gets left behind by left behind places" </a> recently won the 2024 Editor's Choice Award at the Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy & Society. For my study on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cjres/rsx027" target="_blank"> Brexit and immobility</a>, my co-authors and I won the 2019 <a href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/2019/07/11/prizes-for-researchers-and-papers-at-understanding-society-conference" target="_blank">Understanding Society Paper Prize</a>. In 2016, my work on the economic value of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jeg/lbv043" target="_blank">local social networks <a/> won the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joeg/pages/urban_land_institute_prize" target="_blank">Urban Land Institute Prize</a> for the best paper published in the <i>Journal of Economic Geography</i>. Back in 2013, I also won an Early Career Award from the Regional Studies Association. 

I serve on the Editorial Board of the <i>Journal of Economic Geography</i>, as well as at <i> Progress in Economic Geography</i>. Between 2017 and 2021, I was an Editor at <i>Regional Studies</i>.

Cutting across my research interests, I’m interested in policy efforts to stimulate prosperity. I have advised governments and NGOs on issues of regional and international development, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.S. Economic Development Administration, and the World Bank. 

Before joining U of T, I held academic appointments at Queen Mary, University of London; the University of Southampton; the London School of Economics; and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I received my PhD from UCLA.
