I am a Professor in the  <a href="https://munkschool.utoronto.ca" target="_blank">Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy</a> at the University of Toronto, as well as a member of its <a href="https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/ipl" target="_blank">Innovation Policy Lab</a>. I’m also a Visiting Senior Fellow in the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Inequalities" target="_blank"> International Inequalities Institute</a> at the London School of Economics.

My work investigates why some cities thrive while others struggle—and what that means for the people who live in them.

I lead the <a href="https://www.geowealthlab.org/" target="_blank"> GEOWEALTH </a>project, which  is building the first-of-its-kind data on where wealth is located in the US, what mechanisms are driving widening spatial wealth inequality, and what its implications are for opportunity and wellbeing. A parallel GEOWEALTH initiative for Canada is under development. This work forms part of a larger research agenda focused on rising spatial inequality in high-income countries.

In other ongoing research, I am developing predictive tools for identifying breakthrough innovations, and exploring their relationship to scientific discovery over the last two hundred years. I am also investigating immigration's impact on <a href="https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/browse-our-areas-of-investment-and-support/the-economy/productivity/"  target="_blank" >productivity</a> and innovation in contemporary Britain.

<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cjres/rsad031" target="_blank">"Who gets left behind by left behind places?"</a> recently won the 2024 Editor's Choice Award at the <i>Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy & Society</i>. For our study on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cjres/rsx027" target="_blank"> Brexit and residential immobility</a>, my co-authors and I won the 2019 <a href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/2019/07/11/prizes-for-researchers-and-papers-at-understanding-society-conference" target="_blank">Understanding Society Paper Prize</a>. In 2016, my work on the economic value of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jeg/lbv043" target="_blank">local social networks <a/> won the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joeg/pages/urban_land_institute_prize" target="_blank">Urban Land Institute Prize</a> for the best paper published in the <i>Journal of Economic Geography</i>.

Cutting across my research interests, I’m interested in policy efforts to stimulate prosperity. I have advised governments and NGOs on issues of regional and international development, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.S. Economic Development Administration, and the World Bank. 

I serve on the Editorial Board of the <i>Journal of Economic Geography</i>, as well as at <i> Progress in Economic Geography</i>. Between 2017 and 2021, I was an Editor at <i>Regional Studies</i>. Before joining U of T, I held academic appointments at Queen Mary, University of London; the University of Southampton; the London School of Economics; and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I received my PhD from UCLA.
