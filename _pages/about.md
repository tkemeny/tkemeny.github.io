I'm an Associate Professor in the  <a href="https://munkschool.utoronto.ca" target="_blank">Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy</a> at the <a href="https://utoronto.ca" target="_blank"> University of Toronto</a>. I’m also a Visiting Fellow at LSE’s <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Inequalities" target="_blank"> International Inequalities Institute</a>. Before joining U of T, I held academic appointments at Queen Mary, University of London; the University of Southampton; the London School of Economics; and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I received my PhD from UCLA. 

I study cities and local labor markets. Much of my current work is focused on the links between inequality, innovation and prosperity over the long run. In high-income countries like the U.S., the UK and Canada, we are currently in an age of large and growing economic inequality, both between people and places. Can we enjoy greater equality in opportunities and outcomes, while maintaining the kinds of dynamic, innovation-oriented economies that have spawned an unprecedented 200 years of growth? A second major strand of research examines the effects of ethnic and gender diversity on productivity and innovation in contemporary Britain (details <a href="https://maxnathan.medium.com/a-big-new-esrc-grant-534a0a0cda19" target="_blank">here</a>). Other ongoing work includes an investigation of the changing geography of wealth in the United States. 

For my work on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cjres/rsx027" target="_blank"> Brexit and immobility</a>, my co-authors and I won the <a href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/2019/07/11/prizes-for-researchers-and-papers-at-understanding-society-conference" target="_blank">Understanding Society Paper Prize</a>. In 2016, my paper on the economic value of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jeg/lbv043" target="_blank">local social networks <a/> won the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joeg/pages/urban_land_institute_prize" target="_blank">Urban Land Institute Prize</a> for the best paper published in the <i>Journal of Economic Geography</i>. Back in 2013, I also won an Early Career Award from the Regional Studies Association. 

I sit on the Editorial Board of the <i>Journal of Economic Geography</i>. Between 2017 and 2021, I served as an Editor at <i>Regional Studies</i>.

Cutting across my research interests, I’m interested in policy efforts to stimulate prosperity. I have advised governments and NGOs on issues of regional and international development, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.S. Economic Development Administration, and the World Bank.
