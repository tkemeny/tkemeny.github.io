I'm an Associate Professor in the  <a href="https://munkschool.utoronto.ca" target="_blank">Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy</a> at the <a href="https://utoronto.ca" target="_blank"> University of Toronto </a>. I’m also a Visiting Fellow at LSE’s <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Inequalities" target="_blank"> International Inequalities Institute</a>. Before joining U of T, I held academic appointments at Queen Mary, University of London, the University of Southampton, the London School of Economics; and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I received my PhD from UCLA. 

I study cities and local labor markets. Much of my current work is focused on the links between economic growth and inequality over the long run. Can we have more equal economic outcomes - both between people and places - while maintaining the kinds of dynamic, innovation-oriented economies that have spawned an unprecedented 200 years of growth and the expansion of human welfare? A second strand of work examines the effects on productivity growth and innovation of immigrant diversity in contemporary Britain (more details <a href="http://https://maxnathan.medium.com/a-big-new-esrc-grant-534a0a0cda19" target="_blank">here<\a>). Other ongoing work includes an investigation of the changing geography of wealth in the United States. 

For my work on Brexit and immobility, my co-authors and I won the <a href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/2019/07/11/prizes-for-researchers-and-papers-at-understanding-society-conference" target="_blank">Understanding Society Paper Prize</a>. In 2016, my paper on the economic value of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jeg/lbv043" target="_blank">local social networks <a/> won the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joeg/pages/urban_land_institute_prize" target="_blank">Urban Land Institute Prize</a> for the best paper published in the Journal of Economic Geography. Back in 2013, I also won an Early Career Award from the Regional Studies Association. 

I sit on the Editorial Board of the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joeg"  target="_blank">Journal of Economic Geography<a/>. Between 2017 and 2020, I served as an Associate Editor at <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/cres20/current" target="_blank">Regional Studies</a>.

Cutting across my research interests, I’m interested in policy efforts to stimulate prosperity. I have advised governments and NGOs on issues of regional and international development, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.S. Economic Development Administration, and the World Bank.
