I'm an Associate Professor in the School of Business and Management at <a href="https://qmul.ac.uk" target="_blank">Queen Mary, University of London</a> (For UK-types: my title is Reader) . Right now I’m also a Visiting Fellow at LSE’s <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Inequalities" target="_blank"> International Inequalities Institute</a>. Before joining QMUL, I held academic appointments in Geography departments at the University of Southampton, and the London School of Economics; and before all that in the Department of Public Policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I used to be a Special Sworn Status Researcher at the US Census Bureau's Center for Economic Studies. And I did my PhD in Urban Planning at UCLA. 

I study cities, and I’m especially interested in the drivers of urban prosperity. Some of the questions I have explored include: how are technology and international trade reshaping the location and nature of work? What happens to workers in local service sectors when high-tech employment comes to town? And how might the experience of living and working in an immigrant-diverse city affect worker productivity? For my work on Brexit and immobility, my co-authors and I won the <a href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/2019/07/11/prizes-for-researchers-and-papers-at-understanding-society-conference" target="_blank">Understanding Society Paper Prize</a>. In 2016, my paper on the economic value of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jeg/lbv043" target="_blank">local social networks <a/> won the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joeg/pages/urban_land_institute_prize" target="_blank">Urban Land Institute Prize</a> for the best paper published in the Journal of Economic Geography. In 2015, Stanford University Press published <i><a href="https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=22080" target="_blank">The Rise and Fall of Urban Economies: Lessons from San Francisco and Los Angeles</a></i>, a book I wrote together with Michael Storper, Taner Osman and Naji Makarem.  In 2013, I won an Early Career Award from the Regional Studies Association. 

For the past few years I have served as an Associate Editor at <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/cres20/current" target="_blank">Regional Studies</a>; I’m also on the Editorial Board of the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joeg"  target="_blank">Journal of Economic Geography<a/>.

Cutting across my research interests, I’m interested in policy efforts to stimulate prosperity. I have advised governments and NGOs on issues of regional and international development, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.S. Economic Development Administration, and the World Bank.
