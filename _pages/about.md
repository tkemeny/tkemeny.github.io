I'm a Senior Lecturer (what everyone else except the Brits calls an Associate Professor) in Economic Development in the School of Business and Management </a> at <a href="https://qmul.ac.uk" target="_blank">Queen Mary, University of London</a>. Right now I’m also a Visiting Fellow at LSE’s <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Inequalities" target="_blank"> International Inequalities Institute</a>. Before joining QMUL, I held academic appointments at the University of Southampton, The London School of Economics, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I used to be a Special Sworn Status Researcher at the US Census Bureau's Center for Economic Studies. And I did my PhD at the University of California, Los Angeles. 

I study cities and regional economies, and the workers who ppopulate them. I’m especially interested in what makes some places prosper while others flag. This is a topic that garners a lot of interest these days, particularly because there are growing gaps separating today's superstar cities from the rest, and because migration patterns are not smoothing these gaps out. Some of the questions I have explored include: how are technology and international trade reshaping the location and nature of work? Does working in an immigrant-diverse city make you more productive? Does partipcipation in local social networks improve firms’ bottom line? For my work on social networks, I was awarded the 2016 Urban Land Institute Prize for the best paper published in the Journal of Economic Geography. In 2015, Stanford University Press published The Rise and Fall of Urban Economies: Lessons from San Francisco and Los Angeles, a book I wrote together with Michael Storper, Taner Osman and Naji Makarem.  In 2013, I won an Early Career Award from the Regional Studies Association. 

For the past few years I have served as an Associate Editor at Regional Studies; I’m also on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Economic Geography.

Cutting across my research interests, I’m interested in policy efforts to stimulate prosperity. I have advised governments and NGOs on issues of regional and international development, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.S. Economic Development Administration, and the World Bank.
