<!-- WHAT I WORK ON -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>What I work on</h2>
  <p>
    I study how urban economies generate growth, why innovation is spatially
    concentrated, and how these processes shape inequality within and between communities.

 “Who gets left behind by left behind places?” recently won the 2024 Editor’s Choice Award at the <i>Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy & Society</i>. For our study on Brexit and residential immobility, my team and I won the 2019 Understanding Society Paper Prize. In 2016, my work on the economic value of local social networks won the Urban Land Institute Prize for the best paper published in the <i>Journal of Economic Geography</i>.   </p>

        <p>Some cities act as nurseries for new ideas, spurring breakthrough innovations, creating new forms of work, and generating massive wealth. What are the ingredients that distinguish these innovative hubs, and can other places cultivate them?  </p>

      </p>
      <p class="work-description">
      Wealth is hugely consequential for choice and stability, and is increasingly unequally held. Using GEOWEALTH, we provide a first glimpse at <i>where</i> it is held, across the thousands of communities where we live our lives.  Our new data tracks the spatial distribution of wealth in the U.S., with data for Canada coming soon. Our broader mission is to develop public resources enabling the tracking of the causes, consequences, and trajectories of wealth accumulation across North America.

        We document that poor children growing up in places left behind by today's economy experience lower levels of social mobility as adults—even when they move away from those struggling places as they grow up.

        Across two industrial revolutions, we show that the production of the most important, breakthrough patents is initially highly spatially concentrated, and that these innovations play an important role in the overall distribution of prosperity across cities and regions.
